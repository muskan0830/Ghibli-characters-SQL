# Whispers of Ghibli's Enchanted Tale || SQL

**Introduction:**
Have you ever found yourself lost in the enchanting landscapes of Studio Ghibli movies? The whimsical worlds created by Ghibli have a unique charm, capturing the hearts of audiences worldwide. From the spirited Totoro to the brave Howl, Ghibli characters are more than just animations – they're magical beings that resonate with our emotions. As an artist who often draws inspiration from Ghibli landscapes, I embarked on a journey to dive into the details of these characters using the language of databases – SQL.

**Objective:**
The aim of this project is to unravel the mysteries behind Ghibli characters through data. By employing SQL queries, we seek to understand their characteristics, relationships, and unique features. It's like peeling back the layers of a magical adventure to reveal the stories hidden in the data.

**What I Have Done Using SQL:**
Using SQL, I explored various aspects of Ghibli characters. From understanding their average age and gender distribution to identifying characters with shared powers, every query was a step closer to unraveling the intricacies of this animated universe. SQL allowed me to connect the dots, unveiling patterns and details that might have gone unnoticed. I employed SELECT statements, aggregations (AVG(), COUNT()), JOINS, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions (RANK()), Conditional Statements (CASE WHEN), and array operations (UNNEST(), string_to_array()) to explore Studio Ghibli characters.

**Key Insights:**
1. *Average Age and Gender Distribution:* The characters, on average, are around 11 years old, with a slight dominance of male characters at 55%. Female characters, on the other hand, make up 44% of the enchanting Ghibli world.

2. *Top Places of Residence:* Characters from Japan, Europe, and Wales take the lead in height, surpassing the average height of characters. Japan even boasts a character with an impressive 215cm height!

3. *Shared Special Powers:* Through SQL, we discovered characters who share the same set of special powers. Arren and Ashikata exhibit super strength and agility, while Fanny and Fujimoto can shape-shift and manipulate size.

4. *Species Distribution:* Human characters dominate the Ghibli universe, constituting 71% of the total characters. Cats and spirits also make delightful appearances, each contributing to the magical diversity.

5. *Unique Special Powers:* Totoro's teleportation, Haku's shape-shifting, and Howl's flight and magic stand out as unique powers not shared by any other character.

6. *Character Heights Ranking:* Totoro, with an astonishing 215cm height, takes the lead, followed by Okkoto at 200cm.

7. *Characters in Post-2000 Movies:* Characters like Haku and Howl, with heights above the average in their respective movies, captivated audiences after the year 2000.

8. *Count of Unique Powers:* Characters like Okkoto, Arren, San, Howl, and Princess Kaguya possess three unique powers each, adding depth to their animated personas.

**Conclusion:**
Through the lens of SQL, this project has uncovered the magic within Ghibli characters. It's not just about animations; it's about the stories told by data. These insights not only enhance our understanding of Ghibli characters but also add a new layer to the appreciation of these timeless creations. The adventure continues, as SQL reveals more tales waiting to be explored in the vast world of Studio Ghibli.
